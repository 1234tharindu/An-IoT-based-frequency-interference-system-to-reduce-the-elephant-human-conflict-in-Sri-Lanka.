# ðŸ¦£ Summary

In my system to reduce elephant-human conflict, I have implemented a three-step process. The first step involves using IoT, Arduino, wireless communication, and machine learning to identify the presence of an elephant. This is achieved by training a machine learning model to recognize elephant shapes and characteristics using labeled images. The model is integrated with an Arduino-compatible device equipped with a camera, such as the ESP32 CAM module, which captures images in the designated danger area. By analyzing these images, the system can determine if an elephant is present.

Once an elephant is identified, the second step aims to drive it away from the vulnerable area using the sound of bees. You have utilized MIDI recording technology to capture bee sounds, which elephants naturally avoid due to their aversion to bee stings. These bee sounds are stored in MIDI format and played back when an elephant is detected. The playback of bee sounds creates a deterrent effect, prompting the elephant to move away from the area and minimize potential conflicts with humans.

Overall, this system combines IoT, Arduino, wireless communication, MIDI recording, and machine learning technologies to identify elephants, repel them using bee sounds, and reduce elephant-human conflict. This innovative approach allows for early detection and mitigation of conflict situations, promoting coexistence between humans and elephants in vulnerable areas.

The system utilizes machine learning and object detection techniques to identify when an elephant enters a designated danger zone. Upon detection, it activates an audible alarm to alert local residents and simultaneously plays back bee sounds known to deter elephants. The integration of a GSM module allows the system to send notifications to residents' mobile phones, providing them with relevant information about the elephant's presence, including location and time. This comprehensive approach ensures that residents are promptly notified, enabling them to take necessary precautions and avoid potential accidents or conflicts with the elephant.
