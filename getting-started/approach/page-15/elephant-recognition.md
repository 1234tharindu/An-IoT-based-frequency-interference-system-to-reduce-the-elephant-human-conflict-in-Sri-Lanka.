# üçÄ Elephant Recognition

1. **Data Collection:** To train a machine learning model for elephant recognition, I needed a dataset of images containing elephants. I collected approximately 200 images of elephants from various profiles, capturing different angles and poses. These images serve as the basis for training the model to recognize the shape and characteristics of an elephant.
2. **Object Detection and Model Training:** To facilitate the training process, utilized a technology called Roboflow. Roboflow is a platform that simplifies the process of building computer vision models, including object detection. Using Roboflow, you labeled the elephant instances in the collected images, indicating the specific regions where elephants appear.With the labeled dataset, trained a machine learning model using object detection algorithms. The model learns to recognize the visual patterns and features associated with elephants based on the labeled data. The goal is to enable the model to accurately detect and identify elephants in new, unseen images.
3. **Integration with ESP32 CAM:**To implement the elephant recognition system in a real-world setting, I integrated the trained model with an ESP32 CAM module. The ESP32 CAM module is a development board equipped with an ESP32 microcontroller and a camera. This module is compatible with Arduino, making it suitable for my purposes. 53 By connecting the ESP32 CAM module to the trained model, enable it to process images captured by the module's built-in camera. When an image is captured, it is passed through the model for evaluation. The model analyzes the image and determines whether an elephant is present based on its learned knowledge.
4. **Elephant Identification in the Danger Area:**The ESP32 CAM module, equipped with the integrated model, is then installed in the designated danger area where elephants are known to appear. When an elephant enters the monitored region, the ESP32 CAM captures an image of the elephant. This image is sent to the model for analysis.                                                                                  The model applies its knowledge and algorithms to the received image and makes a determination: whether the captured image contains an elephant or not. Based on this determination, the system can identify the presence of an elephant in the danger area.                            By combining IoT technology, Arduino, and machine learning, you have created a system that can recognize elephants using image analysis. This technology allows for early detection and identification of elephants in areas prone to humanelephant conflict, enabling appropriate actions to be taken to mitigate conflicts and protect both human and elephant populations.
