# üêò Approach

**Introduction**

In this context I discuss the Approach in my research. Basically In my system to reduce elephant-human conflict, I have implemented a three-step process. They are,

* Elephant Recognition
* Driving away the elephant using the sound of bees
* As the awareness of the vulnerable area

This innovative system combines various technologies such as IoT, Arduino, wireless communication, MIDI recording, and machine learning to address the issue of elephant-human conflict in vulnerable areas. By utilizing machine learning and object detection, the system can identify when an elephant enters a danger zone. When detection occurs, the system triggers an audible alarm to alert local residents while simultaneously playing bee sounds known to repel elephants.

Furthermore, the integration of a GSM module allows the system to send timely notifications to residents' mobile phones, providing them with essential information about the elephant's presence, including location and time. This comprehensive approach ensures that residents are promptly informed, empowering them to take necessary precautions and avoid potential accidents or conflicts with elephants.

Overall, this system's ability to detect and mitigate conflict situations in a timely manner fosters coexistence between humans and elephants in vulnerable areas, reducing potential risks for both parties involved.
