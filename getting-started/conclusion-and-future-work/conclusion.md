# üêò Conclusion

The introduction of new technology devices such as ESP32 CAM, SIM900 GSM Module, Arduino boards, Alarm modules, and machine learning technology offers a potential solution to the human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka. This system aims to replace traditional methods and address the challenges associated with this issue.

One of the advantages of the new system is its ability to reduce human-elephant conflicts. By utilizing machine learning technology, the system can accurately detect the presence of elephants and provide early warnings to farmers or relevant authorities. This allows for timely interventions and preventive measures to minimize conflicts between humans and elephants.

Moreover, the system helps in reducing elephant deaths caused by humans. By detecting elephants in the designated danger areas, it enables wildlife officials or local communities to take immediate actions to divert or deter elephants, preventing harmful encounters or accidents.

Similarly, the system also contributes to reducing human deaths caused by elephants. Early detection and timely alerts allow people to take precautionary measures and avoid potentially dangerous situations. By providing vital information about elephant movements, the system empowers individuals to make informed decisions and ensure their safety.

Another advantage of this new system is its ability to protect property. By promptly identifying the presence of elephants near agricultural lands or human settlements, it enables farmers and residents to take appropriate measures to safeguard their property and crops. This can help reduce economic losses and the negative impact on livelihoods.

Furthermore, the system is cost-effective and easily deployable in rural areas. The devices used, such as ESP32 CAM, SIM900 GSM Module, and Arduino boards, are relatively inexpensive and can be easily installed and maintained. This accessibility makes it feasible to implement the system in remote locations where human-elephant conflicts are prevalent.

By studying the data collected over an extended period of time by this new system, wildlife officials can analyze the timing and patterns of wildlife damage. This information can provide valuable insights for decision-making regarding human settlement expansion, land use planning, and implementing appropriate mitigation measures to minimize conflicts between humans and elephants.

Overall, the introduction of this new technology system offers several advantages in addressing the human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka. Its ability to reduce conflicts, protect lives and property, and provide valuable data for future decisionmaking makes it a promising approach to mitigate the challenges associated with this issue.
