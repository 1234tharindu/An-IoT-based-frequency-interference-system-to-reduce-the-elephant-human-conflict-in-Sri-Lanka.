# ðŸ¦£ Future work

In the future, I hope to overcome some of the limitations of this current study.

Accordingly, not only to reduce human elephant conflict , but also to reduce to prevent wild elephant train accidents, as well as to protect animals that are facing the threat of extinction in the future due to illegal methods used by people to protect their property.

This method can be adjusted. Currently the ESP 32 CAM module, GSM module used in this system is battery operated and its lifetime is limited to only a few months. But in the future, I hope to develop the system to be able to use solar panels for this. And currently this only works in a small area and it can be further developed in the future using techniques like LORA to transmit data to a very distant area.

IoT technology seems to be advancing day by day. The day with the advancement of new technology. So people today are interested in using new technologies instead of traditional methods for many problems. So this method is also based on new technology. And because it is manufactured using IoT technology and manufactured at a low cost, there will be a huge demand for such systems in the future.
