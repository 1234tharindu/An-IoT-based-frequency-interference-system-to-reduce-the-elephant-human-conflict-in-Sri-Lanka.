# üêò Release the bee‚Äôs sound

After identify the elephant, the sound of the bee is used to drive the elephant away. I use a 3v speaker to make the sound of the bee.3v Speaker must be connected to the ardunio board. It is explain by the following code and Diagram.



<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-13 154018.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>3V Speaker connect to the the Arduino board</p></figcaption></figure>

In here explain how to connect Speaker‚Äôs pin to Arduino board‚Äôs pin.

* Connect the speaker's positive lead (red wire) to the Arduino Uno's digital pin 3.
* Connect the speaker's negative lead (black wire) to the Arduino Uno's ground pin (GND).



**>> The arduino code used to connect the 3V speaker to the arduino board is given below.**
