# üêò Prototype of Elephant Detection and Repel system

Overall, this system combines IoT, Arduino, wireless communication, MIDI recording, and machine learning technologies to identify elephants, repel them using bee sounds, and reduce elephant-human conflict. This innovative approach allows for early detection and mitigation of conflict situations, promoting coexistence between humans and elephants in vulnerable areas.

The system utilizes machine learning and object detection techniques to identify when an elephant enters a designated danger zone. Upon detection, it activates an audible alarm to alert local residents and simultaneously plays back bee sounds known to deter elephants. The integration of a GSM module allows the system to send notifications to residents' mobile phones, providing them with relevant information about the elephant's presence, including location and time. This comprehensive approach ensures that residents are promptly notified, enabling them to take necessary precautions and avoid potential accidents or conflicts with the elephant.
