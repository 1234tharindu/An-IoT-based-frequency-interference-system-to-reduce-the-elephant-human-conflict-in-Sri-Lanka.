**Introduction**

In this context, the human-elephant conflict has been a major problem in recent years. The human-elephant conflict refers to the conflicts and issues that arise when human populations come into contact and conflict with wild elephant populations. This conflict has become a significant problem in various regions, including Sri Lanka. The increasing encroachment of human settlements into elephant habitats has led to a rise in incidents of elephants damaging crops, property, and even causing harm or fatalities to humans. Traditionally, attempts to mitigate the human-elephant conflict have focused on natural methods such as creating buffer zones, elephant corridors, and employing various non-invasive techniques to deter elephants from human settlements. However, these methods have not provided definitive solutions, as elephants often adapt and find ways to overcome the deterrents. Due to the persistent nature of the human-elephant conflict, efforts have now shifted towards exploring new technologies to address the problem. These technological approaches aim to complement or replace existing methods and provide more effective and sustainable solutions.

This Document provides an overview of the system designed to reduce humanelephant conflict by using IoT technology and frequency (bee‚Äòs sound) to detect the wild elephants using ESP 32 cam module, object detection model (roboflow), GSM modules, and Arduino Board devices. As in the case of research, the need for a fast, cost-effective solution based on new technology to minimize human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka has repeatedly arisen. This system, which uses an elephant object detection model(roboflow), GSM module, ardunio technology can provide solutions to the above issues for a number of reasons, including autonomy, integrity, and timeliness.
