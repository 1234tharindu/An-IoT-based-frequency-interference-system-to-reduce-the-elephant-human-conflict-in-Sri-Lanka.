# ðŸ¦£ Summary

The designed system to reduce human-elephant conflict by using IoT technology and frequency (bee's sound) integration provides a comprehensive and innovative approach to address the challenges of minimizing human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka.

Fast and Timely Detection: The use of the ESP32 CAM module in combination with the elephant object detection model (trained using Roboflow) enables the system to quickly detect the presence of elephants in designated danger zones. The object detection model can analyze images captured by the module in real-time and promptly identify elephants, ensuring timely alerts and responses.

Cost-Effectiveness: The system employs cost-effective IoT technologies like the ESP32 CAM module and GSM module, which are relatively affordable and readily available. By using such technologies, the system can be deployed in multiple locations without incurring significant costs, making it scalable and accessible to vulnerable areas in Sri Lanka.

Autonomy and Uninterrupted Monitoring: Once deployed, the system operates autonomously, continuously monitoring the danger zones for elephant activity. The integration of IoT devices allows the system to function without constant human intervention, reducing the need for continuous manpower and ensuring uninterrupted surveillance.

Integrity and Accuracy: The elephant object detection model trained with Roboflow ensures high accuracy in recognizing elephants, reducing false positives and negatives. This accuracy ensures that only valid elephant sightings trigger the response mechanisms, avoiding unnecessary disruptions to the local community.

Remote Communication and Notification: The SIM900 GSM module enables remote communication with the system. When an elephant is detected, the system can automatically send notifications to local residents' mobile phones, providing them with critical information about the elephant's presence, location, and time. This real time communication empowers the community to take immediate precautions and ensures their safety.

Bee Sound Frequency Deterrent: By utilizing bee sounds (a natural deterrent for elephants) through MIDI recording technology and a speaker connected to the Arduino board, the system can influence the elephant's behavior without causing harm to the animals. This approach promotes non-violent and humane conflict mitigation strategies.

Overall, the system offers a holistic solution to address human-elephant conflict by effectively detecting elephants, providing timely alerts to residents, and encouraging elephants to move away from vulnerable areas without causing harm to the animals. The combination of autonomy, integrity, and timely responses makes this system a promising approach to tackle the challenges of human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka and beyond.
