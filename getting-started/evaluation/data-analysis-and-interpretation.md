# üêò Data Analysis and interpretation

Human‚Äìelephant conflict (HEC) is a severe and much-debated issue in Sri Lanka. The research area selected for this study is the Udawalawa area in the Rathnapura district. The Udawalawa area is chosen because it is known for being highly susceptible to human-elephant conflict. Here, I discussed with 50 people in this area regarding the human-elephant conflict. A very large number of them mentioned that the damage caused to the crops is very large. The large damage caused to crops in the context of human-elephant conflict can be attributed to several factors. Elephants are herbivores and consume a substantial amount of vegetation to meet their daily nutritional requirements. When elephants venture into agricultural areas, they are attracted to the crops due to the availability of a concentrated food source. Especially in this area, sugarcane cultivation is very successful, so the impact of wild elephants is very common.

The villagers in the mentioned area have adopted several measures to minimize crop damage caused by wild elephants. Among these methods, the construction of electric fences and large-scale trenching are commonly used.

* Electric Fences: Electric fences are erected around agricultural fields or plantations to create a barrier that deters elephants from entering and damaging crops. These fences are made of strong wire or ropes, which are connected to an electric power source. When an elephant touches the fence, it completes an electrical circuit and receives a non-lethal electric shock.
* Large-scale Trenching: Another commonly used method is the creation of large-scale trenches or ditches around agricultural areas. These trenches act as physical barriers that are difficult for elephants to cross. They are usually dug deep and wide enough to prevent elephants from stepping over or crossing them easily.

While electric fences are widely used in selected areas to mitigate crop damage caused by animals, But this method harms humans as well as wild elephants. It is true that this method can have negative impacts on both humans and animals, which may make it unsuitable in certain contexts. Therefore, it can be shown that this method is not the most suitable method. According to the data obtained from the discussion and observation, it is clear that the methods currently used to reduce crop damage caused by wild elephant are not successful.

Of the 50 respondents who participated in the questionnaire sample, 94% stated that a new technology solution was necessary. Therefore, developing a system based on modern technology will be more beneficial. According to this report, wild elephants are destroying crops in the villages of these regions. The inhabitants of such locations have suffered significant economic losses as a result.&#x20;

Although it has not been successful, the traditional electric fence in the area is still used to keep wild animals out of human settlements. Additionally, they use risky and unlawful measures to solve this issue in a variety of ways. As a result, the local farmers are searching for a long-term solution to this issue. Data indicates that the area's problem will be resolved by the new system, which is being constructed utilising IoT technology. The new technique, according to the villagers, can lessen the issue if wild elephant can be found before they destroy crops and enter villages.
