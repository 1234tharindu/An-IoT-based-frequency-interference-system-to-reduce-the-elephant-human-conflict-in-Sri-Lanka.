# ðŸ¦£ Summary

In the lab evaluation, the system performed successfully at each step. The data collection phase resulted in a diverse dataset of labeled images. The model training process yielded a trained roboflow model with good performance metrics. The model evaluation showed high accuracy, precision indicating the model's effectiveness in identifying elephants.

Integration testing demonstrated that the system accurately detected elephants, activated alarms, and played back bee sounds as intended. Performance and reliability testing indicated that the system performed well under various conditions, responding promptly and without significant delays.

User experience testing received positive feedback, confirming that the system was user-friendly and effective in deterring elephants. Overall, the lab evaluation showed promise for reducing elephant-human conflict and promoting coexistence in vulnerable areas.

It's important to note that these evaluation results were obtained in a controlled lab environment. Real-world deployment may present additional challenges and considerations that need to be addressed for the system's effectiveness.
