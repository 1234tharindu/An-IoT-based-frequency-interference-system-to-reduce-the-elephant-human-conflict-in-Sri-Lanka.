# ðŸ¦£ Problem Statement

The human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka refers to the escalating conflict between human communities and elephant populations due to various factors. The expansion of human settlements, agricultural activities, and infrastructure development has led to the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats. As a result, elephants are increasingly forced into close proximity with human-inhabited areas, leading to conflicts over limited space and resources.

This conflict has detrimental effects on both humans and elephants. Elephants frequently raid crops, causing significant damage to agricultural fields and resulting in economic losses for farmers. Property destruction, such as damaging homes or infrastructure, is also a common occurrence. Moreover, both humans and elephants are at risk of injury or even death during these conflicts. One concerning aspect is the rising number of retaliatory killings by farmers. Frustrated by the crop raids and property damage caused by elephants, some farmers resort to extreme measures, including killing elephants to protect their livelihoods. This violence against elephants highlights the severity of the issue and the urgent need for effective solutions. The human-elephant conflict is further exacerbated by Sri Lanka's population growth.

As the population increases, more land is required for human settlements and agriculture. This leads to encroachment into wildlife habitats, reducing available space for elephants and intensifying the conflict. Addressing the human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka requires comprehensive efforts. Strict enforcement of laws against poaching and illegal trade of elephant parts is essential to protect elephant populations. The governments as well as the people have taken various measures to reduce the human-elephant conflict. Currently, many different measures are being followed to solve the elephant-human conflict. They are,&#x20;

* Use of loud noise and flashing of lights
* Chili fences
* Creating smoke and fire
* Wire fence, Electric fences
* Chemical repellents
* Measures such as trapping wild elephants have been taken but have not been very successful.

There is still a need for a new solution to all problems that can save the lives of humans as well as wild elephants. The solution is not to frame the lives of wild elephants and humans. As there is no permanent solution to the human-elephant conflict, people are afraid to live in rural areas as well as to farm. The project aims to reduce human-elephant conflict, reduce wild elephant deaths and human deaths, and minimize accidents caused by wild elephant.
