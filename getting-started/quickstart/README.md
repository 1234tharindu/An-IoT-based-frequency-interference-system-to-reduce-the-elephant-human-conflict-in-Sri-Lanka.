Sri Lanka has a long history that spans millions of years, and throughout its history, elephants have played a significant role. The written history of Sri Lanka begins around 600 BC and is documented in a book called the "Mahawansa." Within this historical timeframe, there are references to the relationship between humans and elephants.One example is a 12th-century inscription found on a stone seat at Polonnaruwa. The inscription states that King Nissanka Malla used to sit on the seat while watching elephant fights, which were organized for the entertainment of nobles. This passage illustrates the importance of elephants in the cultural and recreational activities of the time. Overall, elephants have held a remarkable place in the history of Sri Lanka, and their significance is documented in various passages and inscriptions found in historical records like the "Mahawansa." These references highlight the longstanding and unique bond between humans and elephants in Sri Lanka.

The relationship between humans and elephants in Sri Lanka is not only a historical phenomenon but also deeply ingrained in the culture. The study of human-elephant communication and the existence of an elephant language and sign language demonstrate the significance of this relationship. Sri Lanka has developed training systems, domestication techniques, and a comprehensive medical system for elephants. The role of the mahout, who is responsible for controlling and caring for elephants, is crucial in maintaining this bond. However, while instances of Human Elephant Conflict (HECs) were rare in the past, the situation has changed in present times. HECs have become common issues across the country. The increasing conflict between humans and elephants highlights the challenges of coexistence in a changing landscape. Efforts are being made to address these conflicts and find sustainable solutions that respect both human needs and the welfare of elephants.

More than 50 countries worldwide are home to the worldâ€˜s wild elephant, mainly in Africa and with just 13 in Asia. There are estimates of 51,000 to 66,000 elephants in Asia, but only 35,000 to 50,000 live in their natural habitats. Sri Lanka is home to 10% of Asian elephants living in their natural habitat, accounting for around 2% of the global range of Asian elephants. Asian elephants are classified into three subspecies: the Indian (Elephas maximus indicus), the Sumatran (Elephas maximus sumatranus), and the Sri Lankan (Elephas maximus maximus).

The current elephant population in South Asian countries includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal have fewer than 500 wild elephants each. Mainland India has the largest population of Asian elephants, estimated at 29,964 in 2017. Sri Lanka has approximately 5,787 elephants, including 1,107 calves and 122 tuskers, based on a census conducted in 2011. This is significantly lower than the population estimates from the 19th century, which ranged between 12,000 and 14,000 elephants. Selective hunting and poaching for ivory have likely contributed to the decline in tuskers, with less than 10% of the Sri Lankan subspecies being tuskers. Sri Lanka has the second-largest population of wild elephants in South Asia. In terms of population density, India had a density of 0.0008 elephants per km2, while Sri Lanka had a density of 0.088 elephants per km2 in 2008.Although wild elephants were once widespread throughout Sri Lanka, they are now restricted to the dry zone lowlands, Northern, Eastern, North Western, North Central, Southern, and part of Uva Provinces.

Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC) is a major issue affecting conservation, socioeconomic, and environmental aspects in forests and ecosystems of elephant range countries. Sri Lanka is among the countries facing significant HEC challenges. When elephants come into contact with human settlements, conflicts arise due to crop raiding, damage to households, injuries to humans, and instances of humans being killed by elephants or vice versa. The intensity of HEC varies based on ecological and socioeconomic factors such as food availability, size of protected areas, agricultural practices, human population density, seasonal climate variations, and socio-cultural beliefs. HEC is particularly prevalent in regions with a large elephant population, as elephants compete intensely for resources like food, water, and shelter.

Human-elephant conflict is a significant issue in Sri Lanka. The country has a sizable elephant population, and their habitats often overlap with human settlements and agricultural areas. This overlap leads to conflicts between humans and elephants as they compete for space and resources. Several factors contribute to the human - elephant conflict in Sri Lanka. They are,                         &#x20;

* **Habitat Loss** - The expansion of human settlements and agricultural activities has resulted in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats. As elephants search for food and water, they frequently enter villages and crop fields in search of sustenance.
* **Crop Raiding** - Elephants are herbivores and can cause extensive damage to crops, leading to economic losses for farmers. When elephants raid farms, farmers may resort to harmful methods like poisoning or electrocution to protect their livelihoods.
* **Infrastructure Development** - The construction of roads, railways, and other infrastructure often disrupts elephant migration routes and blocks their access to water sources, leading to increased human-elephant conflicts.
* **Poaching and Retaliatory Killings**: Illegal poaching of elephants for their ivory and body parts remains a threat. Additionally, retaliatory killings occur when elephants cause damage or pose a threat to human lives, aggravating the conflict further.

The figure illustrates the changing trends in human and elephant deaths in Sri Lanka since 1991. Initially, the number of human and elephant deaths was equal in 1991. However, over the years, there has been a consistent increase in the number of elephant deaths, particularly in recent times. The majority of these deaths are a result of human-elephant conflict (HEC), highlighting the escalation of violence against elephants. This data emphasizes the seriousness and urgency of addressing the human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka.

Over the past three decades, the average annual human death rate due to humanelephant conflict (HEC) in Sri Lanka has shown an increasing trend. From 1992 to 2001, the average was 54 deaths per year, rising to 62 deaths per year from 2002 to 2011. From 2012 to 2021, the average increased further to 93 deaths per year. This represents an approximate 42% increase in the human killing rate by elephants over the previous three decades. In 2021, the number of human deaths due to HEC reached 142, marking a significant spike.

It is worth noting that despite some fluctuations, the number of human deaths caused by HEC has consistently exceeded 100 per year in the last three years. In total, within the past 30 years, Sri Lanka has reported 2,111 human casualties and 5,954 elephant casualties as a result of the human-elephant conflict. These figures highlight the severity and ongoing nature of the issue in the country.&#x20;

According to the DWC (Fig. 4), human deaths are more concentrated in the wildlife regions in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Ampara, Monaragala, Batticaloa, and Kurunegala, while elephant deaths are spread throughout the affected HEC region. The majority of human casualties are male since most HEC incidents occur at night when females in Sri Lankan villages generally do not go out.

The number of properties damaged has fluctuated but increased. From 2011 to 2021, this reached more than 1,000 per year, with a peak of 2,195 incidents recorded in 2020. Between 1991 and 2021, a total of 27,344 cases were reported, with the worst incidents occurring in Polonnaruwa, Ampara, Badulla, Monaragala, Anuradhapura, and Kurunegala.

As there is no permanent solution to the human-elephant conflict, people are afraid to live in rural areas as well as to farm. The project aims to reduce human-elephant conflict, reduce wild elephant deaths and human deaths, and minimize accidents caused by wild elephant.
