The expansion of human settlements and agricultural fields in Asia and Africa has resulted in the loss of elephant habitat, leading to increased human-elephant conflict (HEC). This conflict poses a threat to biodiversity conservation and is a major environmental and socio-economic crisis in rural Sri Lanka. Annually, elephants in Sri Lanka cause over $10 million in crop and property damage, leading to retaliatory killings by farmers. On average, 225 elephants have been killed by farmers each year since 2008, while human casualties range from 60 to 80 annually, mostly occurring in villages and fields. Sri Lanka's current population density, with approximately 300 humans per square kilometer, is growing rapidly, with around 750 people added daily. This population growth drives the encroachment of humans into wildlife habitats, exacerbating the human-elephant conflict. Sri Lanka is home to around 6,000 elephants, accounting for 10% of the global elephant population .Due to human disturbances during the day, elephants have adapted to become more nocturnal and secretive, seeking food at night and occasionally attacking humans upon hearing their voices. This shift in behavior has impacted the elephants' quality of life and freedom. Overall, the human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka is a pressing issue, affecting both human livelihoods and elephant conservation efforts. Addressing this conflict requires effective measures to mitigate crop damage, protect habitats, promote coexistence, and ensure the long-term survival of both humans and elephants. According to a study conducted by the Department of Wildlife and Conservation (DWLC), it is found that 65 % of the Sri Lankan elephant population has fallen since the turn of the 19th Century.

It can be recognized from the increasing number of human death of elephants that none of the measures mentioned above have been successful. Clearly, the problem I have identified is that the strategies currently in place are not effective in reducing the annual HEC deaths in Sri Lanka. At present, among the methods used to reduce human-elephant conflict in the world, the use of insects can be identified as one of the most researched areas. Bee is widely used among them. This study presents a proposed new system based on new technology to mitigate human-elephant conflict which is currently a serious problem in rural areas. The model will pave the way for minimizing long-standing conflict between elephants and humans using technologies such as the IoT technology and bee sound (frequency) and the new system will allow humans as well as wild elephants to save their lives. It can save the lives of wild elephants, human lives and human property.
