# üêò Summary

According to existing literature, an effective solution to human-elephant conflict necessitates the development of a more accessible, user-friendly, and cost-effective technology-based system. Animal tracking technology, such as IoT-based systems, plays a crucial role in mitigating human-elephant conflict by providing valuable data and insights. The researchers emphasize that for such a system to be successful, it should be efficient and capable of delivering accurate and timely information. Furthermore, ThiS efficient low-cost IoT based freqency (bee' sound) interference system‚Äñ designed to reduce human elephant conflict has been developed to provide real benefits to people living in rural areas, wildlife officers, and wild elephants. In implementing this technology, the researcher found that according to the literature, an ‚Äñefficient low-cost IoT based freqency (bee' sound) interference system‚Äñ could be standardized, overcoming the shortcomings of previous research reports. According to the literature, the issue of human-elephant conflict is of great importance these days. Although various solutions have been introduced, they have not been very successful. Lastly, I discovered that IoT technology might be used to provide a long-term solution to the conflict between humans and elephants based on the literature.
