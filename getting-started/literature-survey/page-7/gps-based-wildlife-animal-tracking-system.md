# üçÄ GPS based wildlife animal tracking system

The goal of this initiative is to locate animals in national parks or wildlife refuges. For this project, a GPS modem and a GSM modem are used. Additionally, these national parks for animals have grown to be well-liked tourist destinations. Here, you can find or see several rare or endangered creatures. Pandas, white tigers, and many more animals come to mind. However, these animals are susceptible to sickness, and there may be times when they need human assistance, such as when they need to be vaccinated. If they were injured in an accident or otherwise, we would need to catch those animals and administer the necessary therapies to heal their wounds.

The biggest issue in these circumstances is that these species are quite difficult to find in big wildlife reserves. We frequently have to search the entire area as a result of this. They are developing a project dubbed "Wildlife animal tracking using GPS and GSM technology" to prevent these issues. In this project, a GPS modem aids in obtaining the location's coordinates. At least three satellites may be needed for this modem. Longitude and latitude are two location-related variables that the GPS modem gets from the satellite.

Additionally, they have employed a GSM modem, which delivers these parameters to a specific cellphone number through SMS. This mobile number could belong to a forest ranger or another member of the relevant government agency.

This SMS will make it easier to find the animal's precise position. Additionally, specific variable position data are obtained when animals migrate within animal reserves or forests. A business-level system, this "GPS BASED WILDLIFE ANIMAL TRACKING SYSTEM" tracks wild animals.
