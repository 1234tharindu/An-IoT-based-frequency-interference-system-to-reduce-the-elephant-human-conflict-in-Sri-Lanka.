# üçÄ Zebra Net Tracking System

The "Hardware design experiences in Zebra Net" test report was carried out by Margaret Martonosi, Pei Zhang, Christopher M. Sadler, and Stephen A. Lyon. The experiences that went into designing sensor nodes and the low-level software that controls them are discussed in this paper. In the Zebra Net system, precise position data are recorded using GPS technology in order to monitor long-term animal migrations.

A 16-bit TI microcontroller, 4 Mbits of off-chip flash memory, a 900 MHz radio, and a low-power GPS chip make up the Zebra Net hardware. In this paper, they go over our approaches for designing effective power supply for sensor networks, ways to control node energy usage, and ways to control peripheral devices like radios, flash drives, and sensors. They examine how the Zebra Net nodes' design can be improved before giving their final assessment. Both building future sensor nodes and implementing them in actual systems might benefit from the lessons they gained while creating this technology.
