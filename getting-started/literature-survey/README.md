# ðŸ¦£ Literature Survey

**Introduction**

This chapter of the research discusses the process and methodology followed in the study, including the review of findings from various sources such as online journals, newspapers, magazines, e-books, and the Internet. These sources were utilized to gather information on the human-elephant conflict and related studies. The chapter also highlights other studies conducted in the field and provides a brief overview of their respective systems and how they function. This exploration of existing systems used by wildlife centers and research institutes aims to understand the existing technologies and approaches applied to related to wildlife tracking and conflict mitigation.

Furthermore, the chapter explores different types of literature from various studies on animal tracking methods. It examines the advantages of these methods, the technologies employed, and delves into the working principles of these systems. By studying and analyzing previous research, researchers can gain comprehensive knowledge about important information, techniques, and problems faced in these systems. This understanding enables them to develop a new system that addresses and avoids the shortcomings identified in previous studies.

In summary, this chapter serves as a literature review, presenting an overview of the existing research, systems, and technologies used in the field of animal tracking and conflict mitigation. By drawing from this body of knowledge, researchers aim to build upon previous findings and develop an improved system that overcomes the challenges faced in the human-elephant conflict context.
