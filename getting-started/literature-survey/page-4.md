# ðŸ¦£ Economic losses due to Human elephant Conflict

Human-elephant conflict (HEC) can be categorized into direct and indirect impacts on people. Direct HEC refers to the physical and economic consequences experienced by rural communities, while indirect HEC has a broader social impact on individuals and society as a whole. Indirect costs, which encompass various aspects of conflict, can significantly contribute to the overall perception of HEC by local communities. Recognizing and understanding both the direct and indirect impacts of HEC are crucial for effectively addressing and mitigating the conflict.

Elephants pose a significant economic threat in agricultural areas through direct damage to crops, livestock, property, and even loss of life and injuries. While other wildlife species also cause crop damage, elephants are particularly feared due to their capacity to consume and trample a substantial amount of crops in a single night. In Sri Lanka's elephant-affected regions, it has been estimated that farmers experience an average annual loss of over USD 200 as a result of elephant-induced crop damage. The economic impact of elephants on agriculture underscores the need for effective measures to mitigate human-elephant conflict and protect livelihoods.

In addition to the tangible economic losses, human-elephant conflict (HEC) imposes significant indirect costs on farmers and communities. Uncompensated activities such as guarding crops contribute to resource loss. Farmers and their families are forced to spend their time and energy protecting their crops and property, which leads to sleep deprivation, reduced employment opportunities, and increased vulnerability to infectious diseases. The psychological stress and fear experienced by individuals living in HEC-affected areas further compound these challenges. These indirect costs are not easily quantifiable in economic terms but have a profound impact on the wellbeing and quality of life of the affected communities.

The opportunity cost of different conflict management approaches can be calculated as the income forgone due to the farming householdsâ€˜ commitment to dealing with the threat of elephants. It can be identified as a percentage loss of annual income. 21 The Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) in Sri Lanka allocates annual funds for various human-elephant conflict (HEC) mitigation activities. These include measures such as elephant thunder, compensation for damages, capture and translocation of elephants, and elephant drives. In the years 2019 and 2020, approximately USD 2.74 million was spent on the construction of electric fences, resulting in the installation of 4,756 km of electrified fencing. Compensation payments for human deaths amounted to USD 0.76 million between 2011 and 2018, while USD 1.7 million was paid for property damage during the same period. Additionally, USD 0.05 million was allocated for injuries in 2017 and 2018, as per available records. These figures highlight the financial investments made towards mitigating the impacts of HEC in Sri Lanka.
