# üçÄ Tracking Elephants with GPS Collars

A GPS (Global Positioning System) device is now included in the collars to help locate the elephant. Based on a satellite network, GPS is able to locate an object on the ground with a few meter precision. The elephant is now placed in the most precise posture every four hours, day and night, thanks to these new collars. They then send that data to a different satellite once daily from six different locations. This solution provides precise data on elephant movement every four hours and provides solutions to numerous management issues.

Already fitted elephants with more than ten satellite-GPS collars. In southern Sri Lanka, they can be found in and around the Yala, Udawalawe, and Lungumavehera National Parks. Northwestern Sri Lanka has seen the collaring of three elephants.
