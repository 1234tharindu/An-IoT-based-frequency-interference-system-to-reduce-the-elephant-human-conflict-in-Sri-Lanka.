# üçÄ Tracking Elephants with Radio Collars

In Sri Lanka, VHF collars are used to monitor elephants' seasonal long-distance movement between the wet and dry seasons. By radio, 18 elephants were tracked. When an elephant wears a VHF collar, the transmitter continuously sends out a signal that sounds like "beep-beep-beep" to the animal. Like a TV antenna, it makes use of a directional antenna. The signal is crystal clear when the antenna is directed at the elephant. The signal gets weak or inaudible when it is turned away. This approach essentially allows you to approach the elephant. 'Home in' is the term for this kind of tracking.

The transmitters have a range of 3‚Äì4 kilometers, and even less if the elephant is in a dense jungle, thus this only works if you are already in the elephant's range. We should locate the elephant, which is around 3 kilometers away, if you don't know where it is. It employs a process known as triangulation. Although the signal quickly fades through the forest, it may still be picked up at a distance of between 10 and 15 kilometers until it emerges from the forest canopy. 'Home in' is the term for this kind of tracking.

Such activities involving VHF collars need a lot of manual labor. Finding each animal typically requires a whole day if there are five or more being pursued. You only receive 4-5 data points per animal in a month as a result. These facts are perfect for addressing issues like elephant migration and the size of their annual habitation range. But which microhabitats do elephants frequent the most? Simply responding to such inquiries is insufficient. Do the movements at night and during the day differ in any way? Such problems, which call for in-depth understanding of the habitats and resources used by elephants, cannot be answered using this method.
