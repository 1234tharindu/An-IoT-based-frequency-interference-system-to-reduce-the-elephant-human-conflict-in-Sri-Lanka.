# ðŸ¦£ Traditional methods people use to mitigate Human Elephant Conflict

Sri Lankan farmers employ various traditional methods to mitigate human-elephant conflict (HEC), often using a combination of techniques and adapting their strategies as elephants continue to test the implemented measures. The primary focus of these efforts has been on preventing risks by creating separation between humans and elephants. These traditional methods reflect the ongoing efforts of farmers to find practical solutions to minimize conflicts and protect their livelihoods.

Traditional conflict mitigation methods in Sri Lanka aim to restrict the movement of elephants into agricultural areas through the use of various barriers and deterrents. These methods include wooden fences, beehive fences, elephant watchtowers or guardhouses, and trenches. Farmers employ defensive measures at night such as making loud noises by banging on tins or drums, shouting, and throwing objects to drive away elephants. Chili peppers and fire are also utilized as deterrents to scare elephants and prevent them from entering crop fields. These traditional techniques demonstrate the resourcefulness of farmers in finding ways to protect their crops from elephant damage.
