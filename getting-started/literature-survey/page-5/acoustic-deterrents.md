# üçÄ Acoustic deterrents

Acoustic deterrents, such as loud noises produced by yelling, firecrackers, metal objects, drums, and tins, are commonly used by farmers in Sri Lanka to scare away crop-raiding elephants. These methods are widely employed throughout affected regions and serve as a means to startle and frighten elephants. The Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) provides farmers in high human-elephant conflict (HEC) areas with specific firecrackers known as "ali-wedi" to assist in deterring elephants. These firecrackers are approximately 25 cm long and 2.5 cm in diameter.

Acoustic deterrents provide several advantages in mitigating human-elephant conflict. They prioritize the safety of elephants by avoiding any physical harm to them, promoting ethical and humane treatment. Additionally, this method is cost-effective and has shown promising results in effectively deterring elephants from crop raiding and entering human settlements. By utilizing acoustic deterrents, communities can reduce conflicts while maintaining a respectful approach towards wildlife conservation.

While acoustic deterrents have their benefits, there are notable drawbacks to consider. One concern is the lack of long-term adverse effects, which may raise questions about the sustainability and long-term effectiveness of this method. Additionally, acoustic deterrents may only be effective over short distances, limiting their practicality in situations where elephants need to be deterred from larger areas. Moreover, the use of such repellents may disrupt the psychosocial well-being and livelihood activities of farmers. These factors emphasize the need for comprehensive and sustainable approaches to mitigate human-elephant conflict.
