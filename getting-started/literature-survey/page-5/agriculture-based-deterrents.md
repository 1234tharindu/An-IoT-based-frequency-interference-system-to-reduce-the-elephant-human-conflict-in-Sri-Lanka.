# üçÄ Agriculture-based deterrents

Farmers employ agriculture-based deterrents to create barriers that prevent wildlife, including elephants, from entering subsistence farmland and causing damage to crops. One approach involves cultivating crops that are less appealing or palatable to elephants. Farmers utilize citrus plant species such as orange and lime trees to establish bio fences. By planting these trees alongside their crops, especially in border areas neighboring elephant habitats, they aim to reduce incidents of crop raiding by elephants. This method leverages the natural aversion elephants have towards certain crops, thereby providing a deterrent effect.

Agriculture-based deterrents in mitigating HEC offer several advantages. They are considered "low-tech" solutions that can be easily produced using locally available resources and techniques. This makes them accessible and cost-effective for farmers. Additionally, these deterrents can provide economic benefits by promoting alternative crop cultivation or intercropping. By diversifying their agricultural practices, farmers can offset potential losses from main crops that are susceptible to elephant damage. This not only helps protect their livelihoods but also contributes to increased income and economic stability. Overall, agriculture-based deterrents offer a practical and sustainable approach to mitigating HEC while providing economic opportunities for farmers.

Agriculture-based deterrents in mitigating HEC come with notable disadvantages. One major drawback is the need for consistent monitoring and maintenance. These deterrents require regular check-ups, repairs, and adjustments to ensure their effectiveness. This places a labor-intensive burden on farmers or communities already engaged in various agricultural activities. The time and effort required for monitoring and maintenance may strain their resources and limit their capacity to focus on other essential farming tasks. Thus, while agriculture-based deterrents offer benefits, the ongoing commitment to monitoring and upkeep should be considered as a significant challenge.
