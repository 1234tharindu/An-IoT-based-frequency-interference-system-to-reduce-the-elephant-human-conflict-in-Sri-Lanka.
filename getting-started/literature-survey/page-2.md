# ðŸ¦£ The status of the human elephant conflict in sri lanka

Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is prevalent in Sri Lanka, particularly in the lowland dry zone where over 59.9% of the country's elephants are found. A significant proportion, approximately 69.4%, of the elephant's range in Sri Lanka overlaps with areas populated by humans. This poses a growing problem that is expected to worsen in the future. Consequently, HEC presents a significant challenge for the Sri Lankan government in terms of policymaking and planning. Addressing HEC effectively requires careful consideration and strategic measures to mitigate conflicts between humans and elephants.

In Sri Lanka, human-elephant conflict (HEC) often takes the form of direct attacks on people, leading to injuries and fatalities, as well as crop damage, property destruction, and harm to elephants. Sri Lanka has the highest annual elephant death toll and is the second-highest in terms of human fatalities, with India holding the top position. Crop raiding incidents in Asia result in over 600 human deaths and 450 elephant deaths annually, with India and Sri Lanka accounting for more than 80% of these incidents. The statistics highlight the severity of the HEC problem in these regions and emphasize the urgent need for effective mitigation strategies.

As elephants' natural habitat diminishes, they are increasingly confined to smaller areas surrounded by crops that they are inclined to eat. This poses a significant problem for farmers, as crop raiding by elephants can result in the loss of their entire livelihood overnight. In rural Sri Lanka, small-scale agriculture is the primary economic activity, with crops such as banana, coconut, sugarcane, and various seasonal crops being cultivated during the rainy season. Wild elephants show a preference for crops like rice, banana, coconut, cassava, corn, papaya, and sugarcane, while they tend to avoid crops like lime, orange, sesame, and cashew. Notably, elephants have a particular affinity for bananas due to their nutritional value and digestibility. Interestingly, elephants appear to dislike the smell of citrus trees. These observations highlight the specific crop preferences of elephants and the challenges faced by farmers in mitigating human-elephant conflict related to crop raiding.

Elephants not only cause damage to larger agricultural crops but also target crops cultivated in home gardens, particularly bananas and coconuts. Home gardens are more accessible for elephants as they require less effort to obtain food compared to the jungle where food sources are scarce. Once elephants develop a habit of raiding villages for food, this behavior may persist even during the rainy season. The increased frequency of elephants entering home gardens poses a significant challenge and risk for communities living in close proximity to elephant habitats. Efforts to address this issue must consider strategies to mitigate crop damage and discourage elephants from raiding villages for food.

The slash-and-burn farming system, known as "chena," is a form of shifting cultivation practiced in villages near forests. Elephants have a notable influence on chena cultivation because farmers occupy forest areas around the villages. Villagers guard their crops and prevent elephants from approaching from October to the end of January. However, after harvesting, people restrict their movement to forest patches and open areas, allowing elephants to move closer to the villages. In February, there is a significant increase in raids on village dwellings, partially attributed to the conclusion of chena activities. This highlights the interplay between human agricultural practices and elephant behavior, which contributes to the challenges of human-elephant conflict in the region.

In Sri Lanka, most human-elephant conflict (HEC) incidents involve small groups of elephants, typically consisting of one to three individuals. Male elephants often move alone or in small temporary groups, while female elephants form larger family-based groups. The damage caused by elephants to houses is influenced by various factors, including their proximity to elephant corridors, the condition of the construction, the dryness of the elephant habitat regions, the amount of grain stored inside the house, and the types of crops grown in the home garden. The extent of damage can vary depending on whether the structure is a permanent or temporary dwelling. According to local beliefs, even a slight bump by an elephant can be sufficient to collapse a temporary house. These observations highlight the specific dynamics and factors that contribute to HEC incidents and the impact on human dwellings in Sri Lanka.

Wild elephants in Sri Lanka frequently cause damage to houses, particularly when food, especially paddy, is stored inside. Elephants possess a strong sense of smell and can detect stored paddy and other goods like salt within houses, leading them to knock down walls in order to access and consume them. Some elephants may have developed a habit of raiding houses and continue to do so repeatedly. As a result, it is common for rice sacks to be kept in the same rooms where people sleep, as this reduces the risk of elephant attacks. This practice highlights the measures taken by local communities to mitigate the impact of human-elephant conflict and protect their homes from elephant incursions.

The year in Sri Lanka can be divided into four seasons based on the frequency of elephant raiding. The dry season, occurring from May to October, is characterized by severe damage as elephants actively search for water. This movement increases the likelihood of conflict and creates a period of heightened anticipation for potential clashes. During this time, elephants often target paddy fields located far from residential areas due to their proximity to water sources such as lakes and tanks, as well as the surrounding forests. In contrast, the rainy season and the post-rainy season experience lower levels of damage, while the transitory season also sees reduced damage. Understanding these seasonal patterns is crucial for managing and mitigating human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka.

In response to elephants raiding and damaging crop fields, people in Sri Lanka have resorted to retaliatory attacks on elephants as a perceived solution. Various methods have been employed, including the use of explosives known as "hakkapatas," poisoned foods, and gunfire. Hakkapattas, in particular, have proven to be deadly, causing the deaths of numerous elephant calves. In 2021, a total of 69 elephants were killed by hakkapatas, 64 by electrocution, 45 by gunfire, and four by toxic chemicals. Similarly, in 2020, 69 elephants were killed by hakkapatas, 66 by electrocution, 46 by gunfire, and two by poisoning. On average, approximately 200 animals are intentionally killed annually, with 70 to 80 human casualties. These retaliatory actions reflect the severity of the human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka and its detrimental impact on both human and elephant populations.

The figure illustrates the changing trends in human and elephant deaths in Sri Lanka since 1991. Initially, the number of human and elephant deaths was equal in 1991. However, over the years, there has been a consistent increase in the number of elephant deaths, particularly in recent times. The majority of these deaths are a result of human-elephant conflict (HEC), highlighting the escalation of violence against elephants. This data emphasizes the seriousness and urgency of addressing the human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka.

Over the past three decades, the average annual human death rate due to humanelephant conflict (HEC) in Sri Lanka has shown an increasing trend. From 1992 to 2001, the average was 54 deaths per year, rising to 62 deaths per year from 2002 to 2011. From 2012 to 2021, the average increased further to 93 deaths per year. This represents an approximate 42% increase in the human killing rate by elephants over the previous three decades. In 2021, the number of human deaths due to HEC reached 142, marking a significant spike.

It is worth noting that despite some fluctuations, the number of human deaths caused by HEC has consistently exceeded 100 per year in the last three years. In total, within the past 30 years, Sri Lanka has reported 2,111 human casualties and 5,954 elephant casualties as a result of the human-elephant conflict. These figures highlight the severity and ongoing nature of the issue in the country.
